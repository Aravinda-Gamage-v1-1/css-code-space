### CSS selectors
A css selector selects the html elements you want to style.
We can divide css selectors into five categories.
1. Simple selector (name, id, class)
2. Combinator selector (based on a specific relationship between them)
3. Pseudo-class-sectors (based on a certain state)
4. Pseudo-elements selector (select and style a part of an element)
5. Attribute selector (based on an attribute of attribute value)
